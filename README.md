I just finished my fullstack JavaScript training with a data specialization thanks to [O'Clock](https://oclock.io/). 

For my very first notable experience, i've been working on a great project [iTongue](https://github.com/Lemogodeuc/iTongue), it's a social network wich give you the chance to learn quicly new expression in various languages. You can listen the pronouciation, record yourself, compare and so improve your skills !

Beside, i'm also currently working on another personnal project with GraphQL, the concern is an equestrian network. This project allows me to evolve on both sides (backend and frontend), and also train with multiple technologies such as :

## Backend

* Express - Node.JS web framework
* Apollo server 2.0 - As an add-on to Express server (GraphQL)
* PostgreSQL - database
* Sqitch for migrations plans
* Mocha / Chai - Testing framework (tdd)

## Frontend

* React.Js
* Apollo client 3.0 - Graphql client
* Material UI - React UI framework

## Environement

* NodeJS
* Git

As well, i'll give the link project as soon the MVP is stable and deployed. The project is private for now but i'll share it in the future so you will have an idea of how it is written.
